# Force Walkthrough
The objective is to force the target contract to receive ether. 

For echidna to solve this challenge, the creator of the test needs to already know how to solve the it. 
Additionally, there would need to be a way to fund an attacker contract and not the test contract which, to the best of my knowledge, there is not a way to do that.
